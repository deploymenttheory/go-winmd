# ECMA-335 notes

`go-winmd` is aligned with **ECMA-335 6th edition, partition II**. Every
exported symbol's doc comment cites its section (`§II.22` tables, `§II.23`
blobs/flags/signatures, `§II.24` physical layout, `§II.25` PE format).

## Materialized vs sized-only tables

All 45 tables are transcribed in `tableSchemas` so that **every** table's rows
can be sized correctly (needed to step over tables and to compute coded-index
widths). Only the 15 tables the Windows projections consume are decoded into
typed `*Row` slices:

> TypeRef, TypeDef, Field, MethodDef, Param, InterfaceImpl, MemberRef,
> Constant, CustomAttribute, ClassLayout, FieldLayout, ModuleRef, TypeSpec,
> ImplMap, NestedClass.

The other 30 are stepped over (their sizes are known; their rows are not built).

## Heaps

`#~` and `#-` (the uncompressed variant) both feed the table decoder;
`#Strings`, `#Blob`, `#GUID` are exposed as typed heaps. `#US` (user strings)
is recognized and skipped — IL plumbing that winmd projections never reference.

## What is intentionally not supported

These are deliberate non-goals (see the package doc), not gaps:

- **No lazy row access.** Consumers scan every row of every materialized table,
  so eager typed slices are simpler and faster than an on-demand `At(row)` API.
- **No generic `CodedIndex[T]` tag types.** Coded indices resolve eagerly to a
  concrete `{Table, Row}` pair — strictly more informative than a tag+index.
- **No table-layout code generation.** `tableSchemas` is the hand-transcribed
  §II.22 layout; a schema-consistency test guards transcription errors.
- **No generics / BYREF / multi-rank arrays in signatures.** The Win32 and WDK
  winmds contain none (the brute-force suites assert this), so such constructs
  return a structured error rather than being silently mis-decoded. Generics
  support will land here — versioned and additive — when `go-bindings-winrt`
  needs it (`IVector<T>` and friends).

## Comparison with microsoft/go-winmd

`microsoft/go-winmd` is the closest prior art. It was evaluated and not adopted:
it has no tagged releases, depends on `golang.org/x/tools` for codegen, and —
critically for these projections — lacks a custom-attribute **value** decoder,
Constant-table decoding, and `#-` stream handling. Its lazy-table model is also
the wrong shape for a consumer that scans 100% of rows. This reader borrows its
good practices (spec-referenced docs, typed enums, bounds-checked allocation)
without the dependency.
